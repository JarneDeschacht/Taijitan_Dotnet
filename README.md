# Project for HoGent and Taijitan 

We had to make a project for the ji-jitsu club Taijitan for our education at HoGent.

From All the projects that were created by students from HoGent, Taijitan chose our project to use on a daily basis.

This project was created in collaboration with: 
* Jarne Deschacht --> https://github.com/JarneDeschacht
* Robbe Dekien --> https://github.com/robbedekien 
* Stef Verlinde --> https://github.com/StefVerlinde
